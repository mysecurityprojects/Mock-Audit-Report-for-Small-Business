**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**:

This report presents the findings of a mock cybersecurity audit conducted for a fictional small business with 75 employees that has a procurement contract with SBA. The enterprise includes a combination of on-premises infrastructure and cloud services. This report demonstrates a practical understanding of cybersecurity risks faced by a small business. The findings reveal several key areas that require immediate attention to protect sensitive business data and ensure operational continuity. Endpoint security, network security, data protection, user awareness, and incident response preparedness are areas that are commonly challenging to small businesses that were flagged during the audit. Actionable recommendations to improve their security posture and mitigate potential risks have been included in the report. 

**SCOPE**: 

The scope of this mock audit includes the following areas:

**Endpoint Security**: Review of security measures on employee workstations, laptops, printers, and servers. 

**Network Security**: Assessment of firewall configuration and wireless network security. 

**Data Protection**: Evaluation of data backup protocols and access control for sensitive data,

**User Awareness**: Evaluation of employee security awareness training. 

**Incident Response Preparedness**: Assessment of preparedness for handling security incidents. 

**METHODOLOGY**:

**Document Review**: Request and review the vendor's cybersecurity policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines. Documentation related to access control, data protection, incident response, 
  vulnerability management, business continuity, disaster recovery, and security awareness training. Analyze network diagrams, system configurations, and data flow diagrams relevant to their 
  interaction with SBA systems and data. 

**Interviews**: Conduct interviews with personnel from the vendor's technical, security, and management teams to understand their security practices, responsibilities, and adherence to SBA 
  requirements. Focus on areas such as security implementation, monitoring, incident handling, and compliance processes. 

**Physical Security Assessment**: Physical security controls, including access control, surveillance, and environmental safeguards. CCTV surveillance, security guards, protective barriers, locks, 
  perimeter intrusion detection, deterrent systems, and fire protection are areas for consideration. 

**Technical Assessment**: Vulnerability scanning, configuration reviews (e.g. firewalls), and review of security tools. 

**FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS**:

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:

**CONCLUSION**:

The audit highlights several common security weaknesses prevalent in small businesses. The identified high-priority recommendations will improve their security posture and reduce their risk of falling victim to cyberattacks.
