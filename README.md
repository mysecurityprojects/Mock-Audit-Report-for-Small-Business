# Mock-Audit Report-for-Small-Business 

**Prepared for**: Kelly Loeffler, 28th Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)

**Prepared by**: Mumbi Wade

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**:

This report presents the findings of a mock cybersecurity audit conducted for a fictional small business with 75 employees that has a procurement contract with SBA. The enterprise includes a combination of on-premises infrastructure and cloud services. This report demonstrates a practical understanding of cybersecurity risks faced by a small business. The findings reveal several key areas that require immediate attention to protect sensitive business data and ensure operational continuity. Endpoint security, network security, data protection, user awareness, and incident response preparedness are areas that are commonly challenging to small businesses that were flagged during the audit. Actionable recommendations to improve their security posture and mitigate potential risks have been included in the report. 

**SCOPE**: 

The scope of this mock audit includes the following areas:

**Endpoint Security**: Review of security measures on employee workstations, laptops, printers, and servers. 

**Network Security**: Assessment of firewall configuration and wireless network security. 

**Data Protection**: Evaluation of data backup protocols and access control for sensitive data.

**User Awareness**: Evaluation of employee security awareness training. 

**Incident Response Preparedness**: Assessment of preparedness for handling security incidents. 

**METHODOLOGY**:

**Document Review**: Request and review the vendor's cybersecurity policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines. Documentation related to access control, data protection, incident response, 
  vulnerability management, business continuity, disaster recovery, and security awareness training. Analyze network diagrams, system configurations, and data flow diagrams relevant to their 
  interaction with SBA systems and data. 

**Interviews**: Conduct interviews with personnel from the vendor's technical, security, and management teams to understand their security practices, responsibilities, and adherence to SBA 
  requirements. Focus on areas such as security implementation, monitoring, incident handling, and compliance processes. 

**Physical Security Assessment**: Physical security controls, including access control, surveillance, and environmental safeguards. CCTV surveillance, security guards, protective barriers, locks, 
  perimeter intrusion detection, deterrent systems, and fire protection are areas for consideration. 

**Technical Assessment**: Vulnerability scanning, configuration reviews (e.g. firewalls), and review of security tools. 

**FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS**:

1. 15% of the systems operate on legacy hardware/outdated systems, increasing vulnerability risks. 
2. 75% of assets are not protected with adequate access controls, jeopardizing assets worth 7 million dollars. 
3. Cloud products deployed across the organization are misconfigured and can easily be exploited by adversaries.
4. There is no data backup policy to cover guidelines and procedures that dictate how data is protected and recovered in the event of data loss.
5. Security Awareness Training should be integrated into the onboarding process for new hires. Many employees have never participated in a best practices training.
6. Leadership has not been consistent with conducting tabletop exercises and is woefully unprepared to respond to a cybersecurity emergency scenario.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:

**CONCLUSION**:

The audit reveals a significant disparity between the vendor's operational focus and their investment in establishing a robust cybersecurity program. This is not uncommon for companies that have expanded and grown their business in a short amount of time. Nonetheless, they must now draw their attention to establishing a mature cybersecurity posture to protect them from potentially impactful threats. Key findings highlight a failure to implement fundamental security controls and processes that are considered industry standards and mandated by many of the cybersecurity frameworks such as FISMA, NIST, and SOC2 that would be necessary to remain in compliance as a third-party vendor.
