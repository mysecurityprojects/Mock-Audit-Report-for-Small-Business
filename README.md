# Mock-Audit Report-for-Small-Business 

**Prepared for**: Kelly Loeffler, 28th Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)

**Prepared by**: Mumbi Wade

**Date**: May 15, 2025

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**:

This report presents the findings of a mock cybersecurity audit conducted for a fictional small business with 75 employees that has a procurement contract with SBA. The enterprise includes a combination of on-premises infrastructure and cloud services. This report demonstrates a practical understanding of cybersecurity risks faced by a small business. The findings reveal several key areas that require immediate attention to protect sensitive business data and ensure operational continuity. Endpoint security, network security, data protection, user awareness, and incident response preparedness are areas that are commonly challenging to small businesses that were flagged during the audit. Actionable recommendations to improve their security posture and mitigate potential risks have been included in the report. 

**SCOPE**: 

The scope of this mock audit includes the following areas:

**Endpoint Security**: Review of security measures on employee workstations, laptops, printers, and servers. 

**Network Security**: Assessment of firewall configuration and wireless network security. 

**Data Protection**: Evaluation of data backup protocols and access control for sensitive data.

**User Awareness**: Evaluation of employee security awareness training. 

**Incident Response Preparedness**: Assessment of preparedness for handling security incidents. 

**METHODOLOGY**:

**Document Review**: Request and review the vendor's cybersecurity policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines. Documentation related to access control, data protection, incident response, 
  vulnerability management, business continuity, disaster recovery, and security awareness training. Analyze network diagrams, system configurations, and data flow diagrams relevant to their 
  interaction with SBA systems and data. 

**Interviews**: Conduct interviews with personnel from the vendor's technical, security, and management teams to understand their security practices, responsibilities, and adherence to SBA 
  requirements. Focus on areas such as security implementation, monitoring, incident handling, and compliance processes. 

**Physical Security Assessment**: Physical security controls, including access control, surveillance, and environmental safeguards. CCTV surveillance, security guards, protective barriers, locks, 
  perimeter intrusion detection, deterrent systems, and fire protection are areas for consideration. 

**Technical Assessment**: Vulnerability scanning, configuration reviews (e.g. firewalls), and review of security tools. 

**FINDINGS AND OBSERVATIONS**:

1. 15% of the systems operate on legacy hardware/outdated systems, increasing vulnerability risks. 
2. 75% of assets are not protected with adequate access controls, jeopardizing assets worth 7 million dollars. 
3. Cloud products deployed across the organization are misconfigured and can easily be exploited by adversaries.
4. There is no data backup policy to cover guidelines and procedures that dictate how data is protected and recovered in the event of data loss.
5. Security Awareness Training should be integrated into the onboarding process for new hires. Many employees have never participated in a best practices training.
6. Leadership has not consistently conducted tabletop exercises and is woefully unprepared to respond to a cybersecurity emergency scenario.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:

1. Conduct a detailed inventory of all legacy systems, categorizing them by criticality and associated risks. Prioritize the replacement or upgrade of systems posing the highest security risks and supporting critical business functions. Consider implementing compensating controls (e.g., network segmentation, enhanced monitoring) for systems that cannot be immediately upgraded. Implement enhanced security controls and monitoring for the interim period while legacy systems are being upgraded or replaced.
   
2. Conduct a comprehensive review and remediation of access control policies and configurations across all assets. Implement the principle of least privilege, ensuring users and applications only have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Define clear roles and responsibilities for data and system access. Implement strong authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) where feasible. Regularly review and update access control lists and user permissions.

3. Conduct an immediate security configuration review of all deployed cloud products against industry best practices and vendor security guidelines. Implement and enforce secure configuration baselines for all cloud products. Implement robust security monitoring and alerting for all cloud environments.

4. Develop and implement a comprehensive data backup and recovery policy. The policy should define the scope of data to be backed up, backup frequency, retention periods, backup locations (on-site and off-site), data encryption requirements, and recovery procedures. It should also outline roles and responsibilities for data backup and recovery.

5. Integrate mandatory cybersecurity awareness training into the onboarding process for all new employees. Develop training modules covering essential cybersecurity best practices, including password security, phishing awareness, data handling, social engineering, and incident reporting. Ensure new hires complete this training within their first month of employment and should be recurring for all existing employees.
     
6. Develop and implement a comprehensive incident response plan (IRP) that outlines procedures for identifying, containing, eradicating, recovering from, and learning from cybersecurity incidents.
  Conduct regular tabletop exercises involving leadership and relevant stakeholders to simulate various cybersecurity incident scenarios. Following each tabletop exercise (and actual incidents), conduct a lessons learned review to identify areas for improvement in the IRP and incident response processes.
   
**CONCLUSION**:

The audit reveals a significant disparity between the vendor's operational focus and their investment in establishing a robust cybersecurity program. This is not uncommon for companies that have expanded and grown their business in a short amount of time. Nonetheless, they must now draw their attention to establishing a mature cybersecurity posture to protect them from potentially impactful threats. Key findings highlight a failure to implement fundamental security controls and processes that are considered industry standards and mandated by many of the cybersecurity frameworks such as FISMA, NIST, and SOC2 that would be necessary to remain in compliance as a third-party vendor.
